**Project description:** Analysis of a large data set of hourly measurements from Cape Verde Atmospheric Observatory. The Project was my first experience with R and required many skills such as data wrangling, cleaning, and analysis.

### 1. Abstract

The Cape Verde Atmospheric Observatory (CVAO), located in the tropical North Atlantic, provides a unique platform for observing long-term changes in marine boundary layer composition. This study presents an analysis of meteorological conditions, air mass origins, and their influence on tropospheric ozone at CVAO across a 17-year period (2007–2024). Using a combination of FLEXPART trajectory modeling, Seasonal-Trend decomposition using LOESS (STL), and Theil-Sen regression, trends in temperature, wind, and ozone were investigated. While wind speed showed no significant long-term trend, a small but significant negative trend in temperature was observed. For both temperature and wind, seasonal patterns and interannual variability were evident. Trajectory analysis revealed North Atlantic air masses as the dominant influence year-round, with seasonal contributions from the Sahara, West Africa, and Europe. Ozone measurements showed a significant upward trend of 0.14 ppbV yr⁻¹, primarily driven by a 0.27 ppbV yr⁻¹ rise in baseline ozone from clean marine air masses, suggesting a hemispheric-scale increase in background ozone. Meteorological variables such as temperature and wind speed correlated with seasonal ozone variability and ozone anomalies but were not responsible for the long-term trend. These findings highlight the importance of long-range transport and background ozone increases in shaping regional air quality. They also underscore the value of remote observatories like CVAO in detecting early signals of global atmospheric change, particularly in under-monitored regions.
